**********
This section of the documentation includes example flows, you're welcome to submit further flows either via a `pull request on GitHub <https://github.com/coldfire84/node-red-alexa-home-skill-v3-web/pulls>`_, via Slack or by contacting `node-red@cb-net.co.uk <mailto:node-red@cb-net.co.uk>`_.

Input Controller
################
This flow shows a simple Input Controller example for a Yamaha MusicCast AV Receiver (using Yamaha AVR Nodes as endpoint).

.. note:: There is no state supported by the InputController capability.

Flow code (copy and paste into Node-RED)::

.. tip:: For this example to work you must install/ use the Yamaha AVR Node-RED nodes.

Playback Controller
################
This flow shows a simple Playback Controller example for a Kodi RPC endpoint (used as a Plex client).

.. note:: There is no state supported by the PlaybackController capability.

Flow code (copy and paste into Node-RED)::

.. tip:: For this example to work you need to install the Kodi json-cec add-on, and setup fixed/ reserved IP addresses for your Kodi devices.

Motion Sensor
################
.. note:: Google Home does not currently support motion sensors, and as a result you cannot use these devices as triggers to perform other actions.

Use the flow below to send motion sensor updates to Amazon/ Alexa - useful if you want to be able to perform actions that may not be achievable locally via NBode-RED or MQTT (for example getting Alexa to speak or interact with other Alexa-connected smart home devices and services).

.. image:: _static/images/montionsensor-example.png
    :alt: Screenshot of motion sensor example flow

Function code needed to submit the state updates to the Node-RED Smart Home Control service, and in-turn Amazon::

    // Motion State
    if (msg.payload == "ON") {
        return { "payload" : { "state" : { "motion" : "DETECTED" } }, "acknowledge" : true };
    }
    else if (msg.payload == "OFF") {
        return { "payload" : { "state" : { "motion" : "NOT_DETECTED" } }, "acknowledge" : true };
    }

.. tip:: In the majority of cases it will be more performant and more reliable to use your local Node-RED instance or MQTT server perform actions based upon motion sensor state changes.
